      <p>The Senior Pastorâ€™s role is to lead and feed. His responsibility is to seek the heart of God for the vision of the church. This vision is affirmed by the Elders and further developed by the church staff, whom the Senior Pastor oversees. He is also responsible for ensuring that all teaching and preaching represents the truth of the Bible and reflects the heart of the church.</p>

      <p>JourneyChurch Elders partner with the Senior Pastor in the development of the church, both spiritually and corporately. These men support the church staff as the primary protectors and encouragers for a positive spiritual climate within the church body. The Elders serve in both a governing capacity and a spiritual capacity, creating and maintaining stability in potentially negative situations.</p>
