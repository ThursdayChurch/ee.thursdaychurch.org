      <div class="span-border-2"><div class="span-border"><h1>God</h1></div></div>
      <p>God is the Creator and Ruler of the universe. He has eternally existed in three personalities: the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. These three are co-equal and are one God. Genesis 1:1,26,27; 3:22; Psalm 90:2; Matthew 28:19; I Peter 1:2; II Corinthians 13:14</p>
    </div>

    <div class="grid_12">
      <div class="span-border-2"><div class="span-border"><h1>Jesus Christ</h1></div></div>
      <p>Jesus Christ is the Son of God. He is co-equal with the Father. Jesus lived a sinless human life and offered Himself as the perfect sacrifice for the sins of all people by dying on a cross. He arose from the dead after three days to demonstrate His power over sin and death. He ascended to Heaven and will return again someday to earth to reign as King. Matthew 1:22-23; Isaiah 9:6; John 1:1-5,14:10-30; Hebrews 4:14-15; I Corinthians 15:3-4; Romans 1:3-4; Acts 1:9-11; I Timothy 6:14-15; Titus 2:13</p>
    </div>

    <div class="grid_12">
      <div class="span-border-2"><div class="span-border"><h1>The Holy Spirit</h1></div></div>
      <p>The Holy Spirit is co-equal with the Father and the Son of God. He is present in the world to make men aware of their need for Jesus Christ. He also lives in every Christian from the moment of salvation. He provides the Christian with power for living, understanding of spiritual truth, and guidance in doing what is right. He gives every believer spiritual gifts when they are saved. As Christians we seek to live under His control daily. Acts 1:8; II Corinthians 3:17; John 16:7-13, 14:16-17; Galatians 5:25; I Corinthians 2:12, 3:16; Ephesians 1:13, 5:18</p>
    </div>

    <div class="grid_12">
      <div class="span-border-2"><div class="span-border"><h1>The Bible</h1></div></div>
      <p>The Bible is God’s Word to us. It was written by human authors, under the supernatural guidance of the Holy Spirit. It is the supreme source of truth for Christian beliefs about living. Because it is inspired by God, it is truth without any mixture of error. II Timothy 3:16, 1:13; II Peter 1:20-21; Psalm 119:105, 160, 12:6; Proverbs 30:5</p>
    </div>

    <div class="grid_12">
      <div class="span-border-2"><div class="span-border"><h1>Human Beings</h1></div></div>
      <p>People are made in the spiritual image of God, to be like Him in character. People are the supreme object of God’s creation. Although every person has tremendous potential for good, all of us are marred by an attitude of disobedience toward God called sin. Sin separates us from God and causes many problems in our life. Genesis 1:27; Psalm 8:3-6; Isaiah 53:6a; Romans 3:23; Isaiah 59:1-2</p>
    </div>

    <div class="grid_12">
      <div class="span-border-2"><div class="span-border"><h1>Salvation</h1></div></div>
      <p>Salvation is God’s free gift to us, but we must accept it. We can never make up for our sin by self-improvement or good works. Only by trusting in Jesus Christ as God’s offer of forgiveness can anyone be saved from sin’s penalty. When we turn from our self-ruled life and turn to Jesus in faith we are saved. Eternal life begins the moment one receives Jesus Christ into his life by faith. Romans 6:23; Ephesians 2:8-9; John 14:6, 1:2; Titus 3:5; Galatians 3:26; Romans 5:1; Romans 10:9-10</p>
    </div>

    <div class="grid_12">
      <div class="span-border-2"><div class="span-border"><h1>Eternity</h1></div></div>
      <p>People were created to exist forever. We will either exist eternally separated from God by sin or eternally with God through forgiveness and salvation. To be eternally separated from God is hell. To be eternally in union with Him is eternal life. Heaven and hell are real places of eternal existence. John 3:16; John 14:17; Romans 6:23; Romans 8:17-18; Revelation 20:15; I Corinthians 2:7-9</p>
