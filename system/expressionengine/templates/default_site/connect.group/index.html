    <h1>Small Groups</h1>
    <p>Through Small Groups, we connect in honest relationships with others by sharing, supporting, and encouraging one another in our pursuits of becoming fully-devoted followers of Christ. Life Groups kick off three times a year--spring, summer & fall--with a new groups catalog, online registration, and a 10 Minute Party.</p>
